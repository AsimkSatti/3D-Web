# 3D-Web

Built with threejs ->https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js

Creating 3D Websites with the use of rendered objects, lights, cameras, and more to offer new and innovative desk and mobile experiences

A planetery island:


This website follows the camera (user) as the travel the planetery site.

The site consists of an island in the middle of randomly positioned stars on the midst of the galaxies.

Zoom-in and Zoom-out properties are limited to maintain site the 3D obj.

The camera(user) and artifical light are synced in position as you travel


Generating an 3D island an OBJ (line 57)- change the name to your .obj

Change the physics in the update function to add interactivness.

I will continue to add links and items to the enviroment to build upon the 3D Web Experience
